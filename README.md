This Python game is built with Pygame, where you control a spaceship to dodge enemies and their projectiles while shooting them down to score points.

Save all the required assets (images) in the img/ folder. Then run the game from the main script.

Install Pygame and run the game:
```
pip install pygame
python menu.py
```
